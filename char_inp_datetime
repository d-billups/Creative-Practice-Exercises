'''Implement the same exercise as Exercise 1 (Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age.
Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will
turn 100 years old), except donâ€™t explicitly write out the year. Use the built-in
Python datetime library to make the code you write work during every year, not just the one we are currently in.'''

import datetime

current = datetime.datetime.now()
#print(current)
year = current.year 
#print(year) #2023
#print(current.strftime("%B"))

name = input('Please enter your name: ').title()
age = int(input('Please enter your age: '))
age_100 = 100-age
print(f'Hello {name}, you will be 100 years old in {year+age_100}')

output:
Please enter your name: james
Please enter your age: 14
Hello James, you will be 100 years old in 2109
