Letâ€™s say I give you a list saved in a variable: a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]. 
Write one line of Python that takes this list a and makes a new list that has only the even elements of this list in it.
'list_comp = [expression for item in iterable if condition == True]'

a = [1, 4, 9, 16, 25, 36, 49, 64, 81, 100]
'''you want i
for i in a
if number is even'''

b=[i for i in a if i%2 ==0]
print(b)
