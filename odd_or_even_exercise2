'''Exercise 2: https://www.practicepython.org/exercise/2014/02/05/02-odd-or-even.html
Ask the user for a number. Depending on whether the number is even or odd, print out an appropriate message to the user. 
Extras:
If the number is a multiple of 4, print out a different message.
Ask the user for two numbers: one number to check (call it num) and one number to divide by (check). 
If check divides evenly into num, tell that to the user. If not, print a different appropriate message.'''
