'''Implement the same exercise as Exercise 1 (Create a program that asks the user to enter their name and their age.
Print out a message addressed to them that tells them the year that they will
turn 100 years old), except use f-strings instead of the + operator to print the resulting output message.'''

name = input('Please enter your name: ').title()

age = int(input('Please enter your age: '))

age_100 = 100-age

curr_yr = 2023

print(f'Hello {name}, you will be 100 in the year {curr_yr+age_100}')

output:
Please enter your name: dior
Please enter your age: 33
Hello Dior, you will be 100 in the year 2090
