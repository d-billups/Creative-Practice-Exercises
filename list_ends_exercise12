'''Write a program that takes a list of numbers (for example, a = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]) and makes a new list of
only the first and last elements of the given list.
For practice, write this code inside a function.'''

c = [5, 10, 15, 20, 25]
b= []

def listx(a):

    for i in a:
        b.append(a[0])
        b.append(a[-1])
    
        return b
    
print(listx(c))
