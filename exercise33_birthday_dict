'''This exercise is Part 1 of 4 of the birthday data exercise series. The other exercises are: Part 2, Part 3, and Part 4.
For this exercise, we will keep track of when our friendâ€™s birthdays are, and be able to find that information based 
on their name. Create a dictionary (in your file) of names and birthdays. When you run your program it should ask 
the user to enter a name, and return the birthday of that person back to them.'''
