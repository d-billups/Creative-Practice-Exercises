'''(Population projection) Python Question
The US Census Bureau projects population based on the following 
assumptions: 
One birth every 7 seconds 
One death every 13 seconds 
One new immigrant every 45 seconds 
Write a program to display the population for each of the next five years. 
Assume the current population is 312032486 and one year has 365 days.'''

'''Step 1 shows an easy-to-read example of what is actually going on--translating the ratios into minute, hour, daily, 
and ultimately yearly figures and then showing the yearly change over the course of 5 years.'''

def pop(n):
one_min = 60/n -- n represents the number of seconds that either a birth, death, or immigration occurs
hour = one_min * 60
day = hour * 24
year = round(day * 365)
return year

births = pop(7) #1 in 7 seconds
death = pop(13) #1 in 13 seconds
immigrant =pop(45) #1 in 45 seconds
current_pop = 312032486
for i in range(5):
current_pop += births - death + immigrant
print(current_pop) #325932971

Step 2 is a more seamless version of Step 1:
demo = lambda n: round((60/n) * 60 *24 *365)
a = demo(7) #births
b = demo(13) #deaths
c = demo(45) #immigrants
for i in range(5):
current_pop += a - b + c
print(current_pop) #325932971
