#Ask the user for a string and print out whether this string is a palindrome or not.
#(A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.)

#for reference--'palindrome : mom, dad, civic, rotor'

w = input('Please enter a word: ')

w_reverse = w[::-1]

if w == w_reverse:
    print(w, 'is a palindrome!')
else:
    print(w, 'is not a palindrome!')
